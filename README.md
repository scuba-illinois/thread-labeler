## Discussion Thread Labeller

* This is a more complex version of the thread labeler that was used to conduct an experiment for the Crossmod project.
* The labeler in this version is a more custom version and has a few additional features.
* This branch is intended as a reference for someone who is modifying the simpler version.
* If you have any questions about how this version works, please contact the author at adishy@umich.edu
