## Discussion Thread Labeller

* This is a more complex version of the thread labeler that was used to conduct an experiment for the Crossmod project.
* The labeler in this version is heavily modified for the conducting the experiment and has a few additional features. Most importantly:
  * Labeling progress is cached in the browser's `localStorage`
  * Progress for each user is also saved in a similar manner
  * The labelling is restricted to only certain comments in the thread as part of the experiment methodology. 
* This branch is intended as a reference for someone who is modifying the simpler version.
* If you have any questions about how this version works, please contact the author at adishy@umich.edu
